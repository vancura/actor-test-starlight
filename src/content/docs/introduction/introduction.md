description: This document outlines the purpose and advantages of Actors in serverless computing
---

This whitepaper introduces **Actors**, a new kind of serverless programs for general-purpose language-agnostic computing
and automation jobs (also known as agents, functions, apps, ...). The main goal for Actors is to make it easy for
developers build and ship reusable software tools, which are also easy to run and integrate by others. For example,
Actors are useful for building web scrapers, crawlers, automations, and AI agents.
