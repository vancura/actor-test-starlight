The Actors can be published on the [Apify platform](https://apify.com/store), which automatically generates a rich
website with documentation and a practical user interface, in order to encourage people to try the Actor right away. The
Apify platform takes care of securely hosting the Actors' Docker containers and scaling the computing, storage and
network resources as needed, so neither Actor developers nor the users need to deal with the infrastructure.

It just works.

The Apify platform provides an open API, cron-style scheduler, webhooks
and [integrations](https://apify.com/integrations) to services such as Zapier or Make, which make it easy for users to
integrate Actors into their existing workflows. Additionally, the Actor developers can set a price tag for the usage of
their Actors, and thus earn income and have an incentive to keep developing and improving the Actor for the users. For
details, see [Monetization](monetization).
